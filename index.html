            <h3>World-class professional web developer</h3>
            <p>When I started coding with my laggy desktop, I struggled so much. Seeking help everywhere but found none. So i decided to do it with my own and that's how i become a great devloper. You may be found lots of developer in the world, but i can assure you that i'm also one of them. I liked to help  others with problem solving. If you need any kind of help don't hasitate to ask. I think maybe helping you, i might help myself in someway. Because Knowladge belongs to the world!</p>

            <h3>To becoming the best AI developer</h3>
            <p>
                enterprise technology
                
                Artificial intelligence’s impact on the world has already been felt in a variety of ways, from chess computers to search engine algorithms to a chatbot so convincing that a Google researcher thinks it’s sentient. So what’s the future of AI?<br /> 
                
                Obviously, the future of AI can’t be predicted any more than tomorrow’s lottery numbers can. But even as the research in the field drives the technology further and further, we can put our futurist caps on and speculate about what the world might look like in an AI-driven future. <br />
                
                For clarity, we’ll focus on the AI advances in the world of business, yet we’ll also paint a picture of the world at-large as well.</p>
